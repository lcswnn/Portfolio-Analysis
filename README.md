# Portfolio-Analysis with OptiFinance
OptiFinance is an intelligent portfolio analysis and recommendation platform powered by the CatBoost machine learning algorithm. We help investors make data-driven decisions by analyzing 1500+ large, mid, and small cap stocks from major ETFs (SPY, MDY, SPSM) to create evidence-based trading recommendations. OptiFinance is NOT a financial advisor. It analyzes the stock market using historical data and machine learning to provide probability-based predictions.


Our system evaluates stocks and provides eight key insights: Probability of beating the market, Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted returns), Momentum based on the last 6 months, Momentum Acceleration (trend strength), Volatility (price swing range), Dividend yield, Average Correlation with other picks, and Market Correlation.
